The final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne.

In the first half of the season, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and many of the main characters converge at Winterfell to face the Dead. 

The battle, referred to as "The Long Night", is so dark that you can't see the army of the dead. 

The battle includes aerial combat by dragons.

Bran lures the Night King into the open, where Arya destroys him; the army of White Walkers and wights crumble. 

Meanwhile, Cersei Lannister remains in King's Landing and strengthens her forces to set traps for a weakened Daenerys. 

The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as Daenerys suffers losses until she finally assaults King's Landing on Drogon, her last dragon. 

She defeats Cersei's forces, burns the city and kills Cersei and her brother Jaime. 

Daenerys vows to "liberate" the whole world as she has liberated the capital of Westeros. 

Unable to sway her from her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. 

Drogon flies away with her body. 

The leaders of Westeros choose Bran Stark as King. Why? Because Tyrion said he has... the best story. 

Sansa Stark is crowned Queen in the North. 

Arya sails west, and Jon leads the Wildlings north of the Wall.
